This is my personal laboratory to practice storytelling and data presentation, the content is the result of different experiments most of them using Python, r and PostgreSQL.

## How to publish a new  post
Just write your new post using [markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax), the header of the file must include the information of the post, using this structure:

```
---
layout: post
title: some tile for your post
image: /images/articles/some_image.png
resume: Here you can make a brief description to in the main page.
---
```

This is information is required to make a succesfull publication:
- **layout:** you must define a template for the distribution of the content in the publication, I have been created a simple layout named *post* if you decide to use another layout check the [Jekyll Official documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/layouts/).

- **title:** this is the title used to pusblish your post, besides it will be used to list your post in the main page.

- **image**: This image will appear at the top post and in the list displayed in the main page.

- **resume(abstract)**: This variable  pretends offer to the reader a fast description of the content   into the post. Try to be clear.

Additionally, the extension of the file must be .md and the name of the file must include the publication date as well as a simple description of the content, using the following notation:

> 2019-12-27-psql_postgresql_interactive_terminal.md

The publication date included in the name of the file will be include into the post publication data into the blog near to the title of the post.
The description included in the name is for (human)visual recognition of the content (please be as clear as posible.).
